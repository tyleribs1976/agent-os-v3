-    Get a database connection from the pool.
+    Get a database connection from the pool using context manager pattern.
+    
+    This function implements the context manager protocol to safely acquire and
+    release database connections from the ThreadedConnectionPool. Connections are
+    automatically returned to the pool when the context exits, even if an exception
+    occurs.
+    
+    Connection Pooling:
+        - Connections are managed by psycopg2.pool.ThreadedConnectionPool
+        - Pool is initialized lazily on first use with min=2, max=10 connections
+        - Connections are thread-safe and automatically recycled
+        - Pool prevents connection exhaustion and manages lifecycle
+    
+    When to Use:
+        - Use this when you need direct connection control for transactions
+        - Prefer get_cursor() for simple queries with auto-commit
+        - Prefer transaction() for multi-statement transactions with rollback
+    
+    Yields:
+        psycopg2.extensions.connection: A database connection from the pool
     
     Usage:
         with get_connection() as conn:
             with conn.cursor() as cur:
                 cur.execute("SELECT 1")
+                conn.commit()  # Manual commit required
